# AugEITD

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package provides users a function to determine a training set for
genomic selection which aim at training the GBLUP model to find the best
genotype from large candidate set. Users will obtain the selection index
of genotypes which indicates to the priority order of genotypes being
selected as a training set. The ranking is based on the augmented EI
value of each genotype. For more details of augmented EI, please check
the [article](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13253-021-00454-2)

## Installation

The development version of AugEITD could be download from
[GitHub](https://github.com/huining0312/AUGEITD) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
#library(devtools)
install_github("huining0312/AUGEITD",dependencies=TRUE,force=TRUE)
```

## Example

Two datasets are provided for users. The tropical rice dataset is
provided by [Spindel et
al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004982) and the 44K
rice dataset is published by [Zhao et
al. (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1467). The kinship matrix
generated by arranged SNP marker matrix are provided in this package;
while the raw data are available at [Data Dryad digital
repository](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.7369p)
and [Rice Diversity website](http://www.ricediversity.org/data/)
respectively.

``` r
library(AugEITD)
# dataset without strong population structure
#data("geno_trop")
#result = gen_sel_Index(kinship = geno_trop,nsim = 1000,n=nrow(geno_trop))

# dataset with strong population structure
#data("geno_rice44K")
#data("subpop_tag")
#result = gen_sel_Index(kinship = geno_rice44K,nsim = 1000,n=nrow(geno_rice44K),subpopTag = subpop_tag)
```
